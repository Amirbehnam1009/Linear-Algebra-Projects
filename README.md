# Linear Equations Solver with LU Decomposition (Project 1)

This repository contains Python code to solve systems of linear equations using LU decomposition and forward/backward substitution. The LU decomposition method allows for efficient solving of multiple systems of equations with the same coefficient matrix A but different vectors b.


## Requirments

* Python 3.x
* NumPy library

## Input Format

The input format for the main script is as follows:

The first line contains two integers, n and m, where n is the size of the square matrix A (n x n) and m is the number of different vectors b to solve for.
The next n lines contain the rows of matrix A.
The following m lines each contain the elements of a vector b.


## Output Format

The output of the main script consists of m lines, where each line contains the solution vector x for the corresponding vector b, printed up to 4 decimal places.

## Example

Input:

3 5

5 6 2

4 5 2

2 4 8

18 7 2

4 5 8

15 7 6

11 9 5

13 12 12


Output:

75.0 -64.0 13.5

-14.0 13.0 -2.0

53.0 -45.0 10.0

0.5 1.5 -0.25

-10.0 11.0 -1.5
